    <h1>Yota</h1>
    <p>Yota is the product of personal aggrivation with overly complicated 
    python form libraries that always seemed to get in my way. My goal is to 
    create something that is flexible and non-imposing on style. Yota also aims
    to maintain a tiny, well documented code base, making it easy to contribute and 
    tweak for your own needs.</p>
