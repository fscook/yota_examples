    <h1>Yota</h1>
    <p>Yota is a Python based framework designed to make throwing together
    decent forms really fast, yet allowing flexibility for making complicated
    forms as well. The default library templates use Bootstrap and have support
    for AJAX based validation out of the box. Yota is small and well documented
    with the intent that if something isn't there, it's easy enough to patch it
    in. Coming in at under 500 lines of code complete comprehension of the
    libraries interworkings can be achieved quite rapidly.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h3>Basic</h3>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-python">
</pre>
    <p>Below is a simple example form generated with Yota. This form uses the
    default templates that come with Yota, and can be achieved in about 10
    lines.</p>
    {{ basic_form|safe }}
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>Dynamic</h3>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-python">
</pre>
    <p>Yota's internal Node and Validation systems allow for the addition of
    components in a dynamic nature. For instance, if you'd like to allow the
    user to add an arbitrary number of dependents to a Form with JavaScript and
    then validate these Node's on submission this functionality is supported .</p>
    {{ dynamic_form|safe }}
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h3>On-Submit AJAX</h3>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-python">
</pre>
    <p>On-submit AJAX based validation allows submission and feedback of the
    Form without reloading the entire page. This is done in a lightweight way by
    parsing a JSON response, as opposed to re-rendering the entire Form and
    returning it.</p>
    {{ submit_form|safe }}
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h3>Piecewise AJAX</h3>
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-python">
    </pre>
    <p>Piecewise validation allows validation to be re-run based on JavaScript
    triggers. In the example below an AJAX request is made on the blur action of
    any input field. You may also notice that fields that haven't been modified
    yet will not recieve validation errors. This is because only form data for
    fields that have been triggered is submitted for validation.</p>
    {{ piecewise_form|safe }}
